**About me:**
Hello! I am ready to and I'd love to switch bussines to broadly speaking - IT and software testing in particular.
That is why I finished software testing course in Software Development Academy and I am toroughly progressing on my own on related IT topics (getting familiar with tools like Jira, Testrail, Postman; grasp basics of Java).
Being former military in FFL I try to carry some values with me: discipline, comradeship, teamwork, openess, and tolerance.
I speak English (B2) and French (B1). My native language is Polish.
I like running (5k, 10k for competiton), Sci-Fi books and PC games.
